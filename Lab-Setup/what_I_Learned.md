## What I Learned

1. How log pipelines actually work: **source → forwarder → indexer → search**
2. Importance of **static IPs for reliable log forwarding**
4. How service account permissions can break log collection **(Sysmon issue)**  
5. Real-world **troubleshooting workflow (logs, services, firewall, configs)**  
6. How to validate **ingestion using SPL queries**  
7. Why field normalization matters for **SOC analysis**  
8. **Practical** understanding of SIEM operations (not just theory)
